      <data key="d6">Scrooge is the central character in the text who undergoes a transformation from a initially portrayed stingy and unfeeling individual to a more light-hearted, generous, and empathetic person through encounters with supernatural entities and interactions with various spirits. Initially depicted as bitter and unkind towards Christmas and charitable acts, Scrooge shows reluctance towards celebrating the holiday season. However, as the story progresses, Scrooge experiences confusion, reflects on his past actions, and goes on a journey with Spirits to discover the meaning of Christmas and redemption. He questions and challenges the Spirit's actions and beliefs, showing skepticism, but eventually becomes convinced of the existence of supernatural entities. Scrooge also undergoes a transformative experience on Christmas Eve, reflecting on his past memories and character, feeling remorseful and penitent. Through these encounters, Scrooge reflects on his former self, remembers his relationship with Dick Wilkins, and observes and reflects on interactions among different characters in search of hidden meanings. Despite being initially depicted as a wealthy but unhappy individual who is disliked by some family members, Scrooge becomes known for his generosity and joy, transforming from a cold and solitary character resistant to warmth and human interaction to a more light-hearted and compassionate person.</data>
