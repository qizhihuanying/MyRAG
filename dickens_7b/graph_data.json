Initially portrayed as cold, grumpily resentful towards Christmas, and stingy with charitable contributions, he experiences multiple visits from ghostly figures during Christmas Eve. These encounters include Marley's Ghost, the Ghost of Christmas Past, the Ghost of Christmas Present, and the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, which reflect on his past, present, and future actions.\n\nScrooge initially exhibits skepticism but gradually undergoes a profound moral awakening, showing concern for the well-being of Tiny Tim. He reflects deeply upon his past decisions and their consequences, leading to significant emotional changes. His interactions with these spirits reveal regret over missed opportunities and relationships, particularly with Fezziwig and Dick Wilkins.\n\nThe encounters also prompt Scrooge to question the meaning and impact of charity, ultimately transforming him into a generous and kind individual by the story's conclusion. Throughout his experiences, Scrooge is described as meticulous in his routine, dealing with a cold, and experiencing insomnia and recurring thoughts about past events. His transformation from a bitter man hating Christmas to one who embraces its spirit signifies a profound change in perspective and behavior.",
